# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome! This is a curated collection of data analysis projects I’ve built to solve real-world problems using Python, SQL, and data visualization.

My background is in computer science, and I’m focused on turning raw data into insights that support informed decisions. Every project in this portfolio is designed to simulate tasks analysts face in industry—data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and effective storytelling through visuals.
